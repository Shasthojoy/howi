# HOWI-CE

HOWI Community Edition is open source project governed by a The MIT License.  
HOWI has been a proprietary SDK, framework and package collection developed  
by Marko Kungla since 2005. It has modular `addon/plugin/lib` design style  
which as collection enables rapid development very wide range of software with  
clean and stable API's. Majority of HOWI was written in `C` while independent  
Addons, plugins and libraries cover 150+ programming languages which could be  
used for very specific use cases within developed software as source or shared library.  

## Goals of 5th series of

- transform multitude of libraries from other language bindings to Go Lang.
- decide which Addons, Plugins and Libraries can be open sourced.
- decide which Addons, Plugins and Libraries will be deprecated.
- implement pre-release designs in Go for Addons, Plugins and Libraries which will be open sourced.

## Redesign with Go
Following describes HOWI-CE design for transforming it to Go Lang while keeping
HOWI's design style and philosophy.

- **HOWI Addons ./addon/<addon-name>**  
> Addons provide higher level API to include full feature set provided by that Addon and it's  
> Plugins to your software. Addons are safest to use since their high level API introduces rarely
> braking changes even when API's of it's plugins or used libraries change.

  - **Addons may import**
    - Go source
    - own plugins
    - any HOWI STD Library
    - any HOWI Library
    - external libraries
  - **Addons may never import**  
    - other Addons
    - Plugins from other Addons

- **HOWI Plugins ./addon/<addon-name>/plugin/<plugin-name>**  
> Plugins are always sub packages of Addon. While plugins are the core which Addons are made of they  
> are always usable as fully independent packages. Plugins are also safe to use and many cases more  
> reasonable to use when you only need features in your software which are provided that Plugin which  
> case importing/using entire Addon would bring unnecessary overhead. As noted earlier Plugins may
> introduce breaking changes earlier than Addons would so therefore that trade of should be taken  
> into consideration when planning your software.   

  - **Plugins may import**
    - Go source
    - any HOWI STD Library
    - any HOWI Library
  - **Plugins may never import**
    - other Addons

- **HOWI Libraries ./lib/<library-name>**  
> Libraries are low level and packages within HOWI. Purpose of these libraries is
> to provide low level bleeding edge features for HOWI Addons and their Plugins.
> HOWI Libraries mostly are extending or providing stable API for external libraries.

  - **Libraries may import**
    - Go source
    - any HOWI STD Library
    - external libraries
    - any HOWI Library
  - **Libraries may never import**
    - any Addons
    - any Plugins

- **HOWI Standard Libraries ./std/<library-name>**  
> Standard Libraries are lowest level and most unstable packages within HOWI. Purpose of these
> libraries to provide low level bleeding edge features for HOWI Addons and their Plugins.
> HOWI Standard Libraries are often extending or replacing language features.

  - **Libraries may import**
    - Go source
    - external libraries
  - **Libraries may never import**
    - any Addons
    - any Plugins
    - any HOWI Library
